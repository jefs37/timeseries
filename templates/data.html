  <h5> Dataset: </h5>
  <p>
    The data contains summarized Google searches related to health symptoms (dizziness, insomnia, loss of hearing, etc.).
    There are roughly 400 search terms available in the United States by state and zip code, along with less-granular data for a handful
    of other countries. The data is available daily, and was maintained from January 1st
    2020 through September 15th, 2022. The values are provided as a de-identified relative index. 
    
    <br><br>

    Date and location are provided as rows, search terms are provided as columns. The csv dataset size is roughly 2E6 X 400, or 1.9 GB.
    This date range is available for download in the csv provided below. We've lowered our dataset model to extend to just six of these
    search terms, and can expand if needed for project purposes.
