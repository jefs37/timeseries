  <center><h3> Project scope~ </h3></center>
  <p>
    Our objective consists of providing a platform to display time series trends and forecast data for normalized
    search terms from Google. Due to the sheer number of features possible with a dataset like this,
    we are focusing primarily on terms related to the medical epidemiology field, with COVID-19 symptoms specifically.
    
    <br><br>
    
    The frontend and backend are created with Python using the Flask library. ARIMA models were used for time series analysis and predictions
    which we will use to predict search term trends. The time series analysis code is hosted in a seperate Jupyter notebook, but important code
    snippets are provided as formatted text. For example, reference the sample below that we used to import our data into the notebook.

  <div class = 'code'>

      <code>
        from google.colab import files <br>
        uploaded = files.upload() <br>
        path = '/content/searches - US Sample.csv' <br>
        df = pd.read_csv(path)
      </code>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>  
    There are a number of COVID-19 forecast applications that are available, ours however differs as we expect
    to have a focus on Google search terms by location, wherein a user can forecast COVID-19 related search terms
    rates for a given state. Groups and stakeholders would include healthcare professionals that could utilize the forecasts
    to plan/prepare for expected increases in COVID-19 cases based on related symptom searches.

    <br><br>

    We aimed to create this dashboard to provide an easy and effective way for interested parties to explore these
    google trends and simulate future predictions.
